skip_list:
  # Long URLs in get_url/uri tasks - breaking them reduces readability

  # In production, explicit mode parameters should be added

  # Using latest ensures users get current shell enhancements

  # Variable naming in roles could be improved but not critical for homelab
  # Future improvement: prefix all role variables with role name

  # Direct task execution clearer than handlers for one-off operations
  # Acceptable for sequential homelab playbooks
